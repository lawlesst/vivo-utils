Tools for ingesting and managing VIVO data with Python.

### Installation

* Requires Python 2.6
* Requires [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip)
* Requires git

Run
~~~
$ pip install git+https://github.com/lawlesst/vivo-utils.git

### How will this be useful for my VIVO project? 

* If you want to run SPARQL queries against the VIVO web application but do not have a separate SPARQL endpoint, like Fuseki, setup.
* If you want to automate adding and removing data through the VIVO web application, which will trigger the VIVO inferencing and reasoning.
* If you want to write customize listViewConfigs but want to experiment before adding them to the web application.
